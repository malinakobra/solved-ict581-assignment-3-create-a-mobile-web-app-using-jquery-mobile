<strong> Assignment 3  </strong>

<strong> </strong>In  this assignment, you will practice creating a mobile web app using jQuery Mobile. You need materials from lessons 5, 6, and 7 to complete this assignment. Please check the instructions and requirements.

Instructions

Use these instructions to execute the ‘Project <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">plan’ </span><u>Plan’ </u>you created in Assignment 2. :

<ol>

 <li>Application Features: The web application has a simple feature set, and users should be able to do the following: a. Create notes.</li>

 <li>Edit notes.</li>

 <li>Delete notes.</li>

 <li>Store notes on the device that is running the application, across browser sessions.</li>

 <li>View the entire collection of notes.</li>

</ol>

How to plan this project:

<ol>

 <li>First, take care of the details for selecting page elements, adding new page elements, and updating the DOM.</li>

 <li>Second, use jQuery UI to build the web application interface.</li>

 <li>Third, use the following steps to use both libraries:

  <ol>

   <li>The first thing you need in the app is an interface for users to create and edit notes. You can do this by employing a form. Use jQuery UI library to do so.</li>

   <li>You also need a view that renders a list of the existing notes. You can connect the Notes List with the Note Editor in such a way that the Notes List will correctly reflect note additions, edits, and deletions.</li>

   <li>Now you must define the features and design of the app, which brings us right into the realm of specifications and deployment.</li>

   <li>Requirements</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

I would highly recommend keeping your design—as much as possible—simple. Your design must, at a minimum, meet most of these requirements:

<ol>

 <li>The application should start with an empty list.</li>

 <li>A form should be used for note creation, so that the user will use <u>it </u>to enter a note.</li>

 <li>When a user adds or removes a note, the main page view should be updated. That means you need to store your notes in a list.</li>

 <li>When a user adds a new note, it should appear at the bottom of the list.</li>

 <li>Users should have the ability to add a note to the list (Make sure to update the list).</li>

 <li>Users should have the ability to edit the note, and that must be accomplished using the same form that creates notes in the first place.</li>

</ol>
